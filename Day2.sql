 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) select
most used commands in SQL
used to retrieve data from a database table.
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
* = all columns
Example:

SELECT * FROM employees;
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table.

SELECT name, department FROM employees;

2) WHERE Clause : working like a filter
used to filter records that meet a specific condition.
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
note: WHERE Clause is not only used with SELECT statement but also with UPDATE, DELETE statements.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Dev';   

âœ… Explanation:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operators in WHERE Clause:
BETWEEN : within a range
LIKE : pattern matching
IN : within a set of values
using and, or & not operators.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using BETWEEN operator
BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. The range is inclusive, meaning it includes the boundary values.
It can be used with numeric, text, or date data types.
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000;   it includes 50000 and 60000 also. use  like >= and <= for that.
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the salary is between 50000 and 60000, inclusive.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using LIKE operator
LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
Two wildcards are often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator: 
% : represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ : represents a single character 
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern; 
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'R%';
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the name starts with 'R'. 
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%t';
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the name ends with 't'.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%e%';
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the name contains 'e'.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees

Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the name has 'o' as the second character.
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'R____';
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the name is exactly 5 characters long

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using IN operator
 
The IN Operator Checks if a column's value matches any value in a given list of values.
it's shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('Dev', 'QA');      
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the department is either 'Dev' or 'QA'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using AND, OR, NOT operators
 
AND operator: used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. All conditions must be true for
the row to be included in the result set.
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND ...;    
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Dev' AND salary > 60000;
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the department is 'Dev' and the salary is greater than 60000.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OR operator: used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. At least one condition must be true for
the row to be included in the result set.
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR ...;
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Dev' OR salary > 60000;
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the department is 'Dev' or the
salary is greater than 60000.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOT operator: used to negate a condition in a WHERE clause. It returns true if the condition is false.
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'Dev';
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table where the department is not 'Dev'.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORDER BY Clause
used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
By default, the ORDER BY clause sorts the result set in ascending order. To sort in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
# 1 2 3 4 5 - ascending order-(lowest to highest )
# 5 4 3 2 1 - descending order-(highest to lowest )
Default sorting order is ascending.(asc)
Descending order - desc
syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
Example:
SELECT * FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC;
âœ… Explanation:
Retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table and sorts the result set in descending order based on the salary column.
