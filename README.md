# 🧠 SQL for Testers — Learning Journey

Welcome to my **SQL Learning Repository** 🎯  
This repo contains all my daily SQL practice and notes, focused on **Software Testing & Automation** use cases.

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents my day-wise SQL learning and practice queries.  
The goal is to gain strong database validation skills required for **Manual Testing**, **Automation Testing**, and **API Testing**.
